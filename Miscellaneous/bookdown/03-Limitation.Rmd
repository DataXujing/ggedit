# Limitations
## Layers
  - geom_text: family is not currently open to change
  - stat_summary: only character objects can be passed to fun.y
    - `fun.y='median'` is ok
    - `fun.y=median` will not work
  - non colour aesthetics of numeric inputs are not currently supported, e.g.:
```{r,echo=T}
      iris%>%ggplot(aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Sepal.Width))+
      geom_point()+
      geom_text(aes(label=Species,size=Sepal.Length))
```
